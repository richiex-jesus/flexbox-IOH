    <h2>JPGs</h2>

    <p>JPG images are good for photos. Thye are designed for handling large color palettes without substiantially increasing the size of the file, making them great for photos with a lot of colour gradients.</p>

    <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="160" height="160" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble"/>

    <h2>GIFs</h2>

    <p>GIFs are good for animations. But, their abilities for color paletting is somewhat limited, so never use them for photos.</p>

    <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="160" height="160" alt="A dancing mochi ball"/>

    <h2>PNGs</h2>

    <p>
      PNGs are good for diagrams or icons. A PNG file of the same quality would generally be bigger than that of an equivalent JPG file. They deal with opacity just fine and also lack color palette limitations, making them excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos etc.

    <h2>SVGs</h2>

    <p>SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning that it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality, making SVG a <em><strong>great</strong></em> tool for responsive design. </p>

    <p>For them to display consistently, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using image editor. If images contain a lot of texts, this can have a big impact </p>
